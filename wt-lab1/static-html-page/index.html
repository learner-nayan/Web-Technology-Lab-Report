        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <img src="https://english.onlinekhabar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Kp-oli-and-Prachanda.jpg" alt="prachand and oli">
        <p>Nepal’s ruling alliance broke down after Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda’s Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) switched sides from the Nepali Congress and joined with the K.P. Sharma Oli’s Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) on Monday.

            The latest development puts the Nepali Congress, the largest party in parliament with 88 seats, in the Opposition seat.
            
            Leaders from both the CPN (Maoist-Centre) and the CPN-UML said that they have reached a new deal to form the government, once again bringing a communist coalition to the helm in Kathmandu after little more than a year.
            
            The Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the Janata Samajbadi Party will also be part of the new Maoist-UML coalition.
            
            Mr. Prachanda on Monday evening dismissed all his Ministers and inducted three new Ministers without portfolios into his Cabinet — one each from his party, the CPN-UML and the RSP — and kept all 25 portfolios with him.</p>
